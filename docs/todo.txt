        Save cookie manually, and relaunch with it?

        sessionid = DIFFERENT for steamcommunity & help.steampowered (store has no session id??)
        
    On logout: steamHelpHistory (end of session)
    
    BUG?: steampowered seems to "forget" machine ID, steamcommunity does not? Only when going from community to store?


    Plugin name "Steam Forgetmenot"? Icon: black background S/F 
    On steam load webpage: 
        if not steampowered or steamcommunity, ignore
        if steamMachineAuth or steamRememberLogin present in cookies, try to remember them, and fill all
        if steamMachineAuth or steamRememberLogin not present, try to fill them from local store
        
    Security risk? :/ - set this as default behaviour?:
        Only fill on manual
        Only remember on manual
        
    Manual changing of details allowed?
    
    Try to find steam machine details in steam folder??? Appdata??? and store in this?!?
    Where's their chromium at?
    C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\bin\cef\cef.win7 ???
    
    Cookies???
    %APPDATA% ? (no, redirects to %USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming)
    %USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Steam\htmlcache\Cookies (SQLite format 3)
    https://sqlite.org/download.html
    
    .open %USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Steam\htmlcache\Cookies ???
    
    On first launch of plugin - try to "store then fill" from there??
    
    
    Contains username (UserID/AccountName):
    C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\config\loginusers.vdf
